I am a PhD student in the Human Development, Learning, and Culture program in the Department of Educational and Counselling Psychology and Special Education at UBC. My Master’s degree was completed at UBC in the Early Childhood Education program and I hope to continue my work with ECE teachers and how to best support them in working with trauma-exposed students using a Trauma-informed framework. When I’m avoiding all of that I’m outside enjoying Vancouver’s forests and beaches, binging netflix and popular fiction books, taking yoga or barre classes, and eating out among family and friends.

Hi folks! My name is Marie I’m currently an MSc student in the Medical Genetics program. I grew up in Fairfield, CT, USA, and moved to Vancouver in 2014 for my undergrad degree at UBC. My thesis project involves creating and validating a neural organoid model of Substance Use Disorder, but I’m also involved in various Alzheimer’s Disease studies. Outside of the lab, you can find me hiking, camping, cycling, or playing competitive quidditch. Ask me about video games, fantasy novels, local craft beers, or my adorable foster rescue rabbits!

**Gara Dexter**

Hello! I am a PhD candidate in the Microbiology department working in the Mohn lab where I study bacterial aromatic catabolism related to lignin valorization. I grew up in Florida and did my undergrad at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. After undergrad I worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory for 3 years on lignin valorization and metabolic engineering. I enjoy biking to school and in my off time you’re likely to find me walking my dog Benji on the seawall downtown.

I am a PhD student in the Genome Science and Technology program in the Huntsman Lab at BC Cancer. My research focuses on mapping the oncogenic journey of a seemingly normal Fallopian tube cell towards low grade serous ovarian carcinoma, and how different gynecological stromas act as guides for that journey. Outside of the lab, I enjoy watching documentaries on just about anything and trying to find live performances around the city.

Hello, Bonjour, سلام, Hola!

I’m Shiva, a Ph.D. student at Sustainable Bioeconomy Research Group. My research focuses on developing an integrated analytical platform for evaluating the role of forest biorefineries in achieving a sustainable bioeconomy. I have two master’s degrees in Biology and Biosystem Mechanics. My undergrad is in Agricultural Mechanization Engineering.

For the love of STEM, I act as the executive coordinator for Let’s Talk Science at UBC. I LOVE sports! I’m a huge fan of hockey! I have been a rollerblade coach for more than 10 years. In summer, you can find me rollerblading, road cycling and mountain biking and in winter skiing and ice skating. I also play tennis, chess and curling occasionally.

Hi! I am a Jamaican PhD student in the Reproductive and Developmental Sciences program. I conduct my research at the Endometriosis &amp; Pelvic Pain lab headed by Dr. Paul Yong where I am designing clinical models to predict poor surgical outcomes in endometriosis patients. When I am not working on my research, I live for moments that allow me to explore the outdoors (hiking, camping, sight-seeing etc.), and delve into things and experiences that are culturally new and exciting! I am also a lover of food and music. As part of the Social Media and Marketing Team, I look forward to engaging with you on the iGSN instagram page (@igsn.ubc).
